# Password Generator

The Password Generator is a Python program that generates secure passwords based on user preferences for the number of numbers, letters, and symbols they want in their password. It provides two types of passwords: sequential and randomized.

## Features

- Generate secure passwords with a mix of numbers, letters, and symbols.
- Customize the length of the password by specifying the number of numbers, letters, and symbols.
- Choose between a sequential password or a randomized one.
- The program uses Python's built-in `random` module to ensure randomness.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/feevah002/password-generator
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```
cd your-repo
```

3. Run the password generator program:

```
python password_generator.py
```

## Usage

1. When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the number of numbers, letters, and symbols you want in your password.

2. The program will then generate two passwords:
   - **Sequential Password**: A password with numbers followed by letters and symbols in a sequential manner.
   - **Randomized Password**: A password with randomized order of numbers, letters, and symbols.

3. Copy the password that best suits your needs and use it for your accounts, websites, or any other secure application.

## Example

```
$ python password_generator.py

Enter the number of numbers in the password: 4
Enter the number of letters in the password: 6
Enter the number of symbols in the password: 2

Sequential Password: 1234abcdABCD!@
Randomized Password: !@D1bA3C2d4c6
```
